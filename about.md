Hi! I'm Tristan Strom, a Chemistry student at Califronia Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. I hope to use my degree to work in a forensics lab and help people through science. I have always loved nature and been naturally curious aboout the world around me. This developed into a desire to solve the puzzles left in the evidence of people and places.  

### Other Information About Me!

I played many sports throughout my life, my favorite (and the one I'm the best at) has always been soccer. I have a little boy cat named Gizmo who brings me joy and makes me laugh when he's being silly (which is often).
